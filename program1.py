#first python program
#28/07/18

# 1.no need to declare variables
# 2.variables don't have a fixed datatype
# 3.strings can be added (concatenated) using '+' sign
x="ram"
y="sita"
print(x + " weds " + y)
z = x + " and " + y
print(z + " are married!")

# adding number and string generates error : you can uncomment next two lines to see that error
# a=x + 10
# print(a)

# x and y now used to store integers, their datatype is not defined
# unlike C,java,etc
x=10
y=12
#Indentation play a key role in python
if y>x :
    print("y=12 is greater than x=10")

#COMMENTS
#this is single level "comment" ....we can sometime call it "Documentation"
"""this
is
multi-line
Documentation"""

#SOME IMP POINTS :
"""IMP points :
1.Rules for naming variables in python is same as in C++.
2.'print()' always prints the contents in new line like println() in Java.
"""

#Toodles !!! :)
